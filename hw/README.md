Add your project proposal file to this folder. Only one team member should open
a pull request. 

Before submitting it for review, each team member must commit to this
repository. This ensures that they are not selected to review their own
work. For instance, each team member can modify one line below by substituting
their nickname accordingly, and then commit the changes. It's so simple that you
can do this directly on GitHub.

After issuing the pull request (PR), a person from TEAM1 who submitted the
project application for review should add their team collaborators in the
'Assignees' field. This can be done by clicking on the gear icon and using the
drop-down menu to select these individuals.

A person from TEAM2 who is selected to review the TEAM1 proposal should add all
of their team members to assist. To do this, go to the pull request, find the
'Reviewer' field, click the gear icon, and select the remaining team members.
